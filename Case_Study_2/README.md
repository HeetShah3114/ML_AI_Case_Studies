# ML_Classification_Problems
This is the solution to a case study based on classsification algorithms.

**The case study is as follows**

You recently got a job as a machine learning scientist at a startup that wants to automate loan approvals. As your first project, your manager would like you to build a classifier to predict whether a loan will be paid back based on this data. There are two things to note. First, there is class imbalance; there are fewer examples of loans not fully paid. Second, it's more important to accurately predict whether a loan will not be paid back rather than if a loan is paid back. Your manager will want to know how you accounted for this in training and evaluation your model.

You will need to prepare a report that is accessible to a broad audience. It will need to outline your motivation, analysis steps, findings, and conclusions.

### The files are as follows
1. *loan_data.csv* contains the dataset used to train and test the model.
2. *case_study_2.ipynb* contains the implementation for the above case study.
3. *variable_explanation* contains the descriptions of all the variables.
