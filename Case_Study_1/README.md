# ML_Linear_Regression
This is a simple linear regression model I have created to solve a case study.

__The case study is as follows:__

A company is actively recrutng people with different work experiences. It is becoming problematic for the HR team to personally review the documents of the work experience to finalize CTC/salaries on their offer letters maunally.

Consequences:
  * Delayed release of offer letters
  * Delayed joining dates release
  * Overdue work for the HR team

Create a ML model using the provided dataset.

*HINT: This is a regression type problem*


### The files are as follows
1. *Salary_Dataset.csv* contains the dataset used to train and test the model.
2. *case_study_1.ipynb* contains the implementation for the above case study.
